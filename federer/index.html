        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p><strong>Roger Federer</strong> ( born 8 August 1981) is a Swiss former professional tennis player. He was ranked world No. 1 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for 310 weeks, including a record 237 consecutive weeks, and finished as the year-end No. 1 five times. He won 103 singles titles on the ATP Tour, the second most of all time, including 20 major men's singles titles (among which a record eight men's singles Wimbledon titles, and an Open Era joint-record five men's singles US Open titles) and six year-end championships.</p>

        <p>A Wimbledon junior champion in 1998 and former ball boy, Federer won his first major singles title at Wimbledon in 2003 at age 21.[3] Between 2003 and 2009, Federer played in 21 out of 28 major singles finals. He won three of the four majors and the ATP Finals[a] in 2004, 2006, and 2007 as well as five consecutive titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open. He completed the career Grand Slam at the 2009 French Open after three consecutive runner-up finishes to Rafael Nadal, his main rival until 2010. At age 27, he surpassed Pete Sampras's record of 14 major men's singles titles at Wimbledon in 2009.</p>

        <h2>Rivalries</h2>

        <h3>Federer vs. Nadal</h3>

        <div class="right"><figure>
            <img src="img/federer and nadal.jpg" alt="Image of Federer and Nadal" title="Image of Federer and Nadal" width="" height="">

        </figure></div>

        <p>Federer and Rafael Nadal played each other 40 times, with Nadal winning 24 of their matches and Federer winning 16. Federer performed better than Nadal on grass (winning three matches to Nadal's one) and on hard courts (winning 11 matches to Nadal's nine), while Nadal dominated the matchup on clay (winning 14 matches to Federer's two). Because tournament seedings are based on rankings, 24 of their matches were in tournament finals, included an all-time record nine major finals (tied with Djokovic-Nadal matches). Federer and Nadal played each other from 2004 to 2019, and their rivalry is a significant part of both men's careers. The last encounter was at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships, where Federer won to reach the final.</p>

        <p>Federer and Nadal held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 17 August 2009, when Nadal fell to No. 3 (Andy Murray became the new No. 2), and again from 11 September 2017 until 15 October 2018 (Novak Djokovic became the new No. 2). They are the only pair of men to have ever finished six consecutive calendar years at the top. Federer was ranked No. 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004. Nadal, who is five years younger, ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held it for 160 consecutive weeks, before surpassing Federer in August 2008. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federer%E2%80%93Nadal_rivalry">more</a></p>

        <h3>Federer vs. Djokovic</h3>

        <p>Federer and Novak Djokovic played one another 50 times, with Djokovic winning 27 matches and Federer winning 23. They are tied 4-4 on clay, while Federer trails 18-20 on hard-courts and 1-3 on grass. The Federer-Djokovic rivalry is the second most prolific rivalry in men's major history; Federer and Djokovic played each other 17 times at Grand Slam tournaments, while Djokovic and Nadal have played each other 18 times at Grand Slam tournaments. <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djokovic%E2%80%93Federer_rivalry" target="_blank">more</a></p>

        <h3>Federer vs. Roddick</h3>

        <p>Federer and Andy Roddick played each other 24 times, and Federer won their head-to-head matchup 21 matches to three. Roddick lost his No. 1 ranking to Federer after Federer won his first Australian Open in 2004. Their rivalry included four Grand Slam event finals (three at Wimbledon and one at the US Open), all of which were won by Federer. Roddick himself said that the Federer-Roddick rivalry was not much of a rivalry because it was so one-sided.</p>

        <h3>Other rivalries</h3>

        <p>Federer and Lleyton Hewitt played 27 times, with Federer winning 18 of their matches and Hewitt winning nine. Other head-to-head matchups include Federer-David Nalbandian (Federer won 11 matches to Nalbandian's eight) Federer-Marat Safin (Federer won 10 matches to Safin's two), Federer-Andre Agassi (Federer won eight matches to Agassi's three), Federer-Stan Wawrinka (Federer won 23 matches to Wawrinka's three), Federer-Juan MartÃ­n del Potro (Federer won 18 matches to del Potro's seven), Federer-TomÃ¡Å¡ Berdych (Federer won 20 matches to Berdych's six), and Federer-Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (Federer won 12 matches to Tsonga's six).</p>

        <h2>Legacy</h2>

        <p>Federer has won the third most Grand Slam tournament titles (20), trailing Rafael Nadal (22) and Novak Djokovic (24). He has been in 31 major finals (the second most after Djokovic), including a record ten consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals. He has earned a men's doubles gold medal, and a men's singles silver medal at the Olympics in 2008 and 2012, respectively. He won a record eight Wimbledon titles, including a joint-record five in a row, and he won an Open Era joint-record five US Open titles, including a record five in a row. He has held the world No. 1 spot in the ATP rankings for the second-longest amount of time for a male player (310 weeks). Federer was ranked among the top eight players in the world continuously for 14 years and two weeks â€" from 14 October 2002 until 31 October 2016, when injuries forced him to skip much of the 2016 season.</p>

        <p>Federer has won the ATP Player of the Year five times (2004-07, 2009), and has been named the ITF World Champion five times (2004-07, 2009).

When he won in 2018, the prize had increased to AUD 4 million <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Federer" target="_blank">read more</a></p>
