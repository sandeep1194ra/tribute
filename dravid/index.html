        <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

        <p>Dravid was born to a Marathi-Speaking Brahmin family in Indore, Madhya Pradesh. His family later moved to Bangalore, Karnataka, where he was raised. His mother tongue is Marathi. Dravid's father, Sharad Dravid, worked for a company that produces jams and preserves, giving rise to the later nickname Jammy. His mother, Pushpa, was a professor of architecture at the University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore. Dravid has a younger brother named Vijay.</p>

        <p>Rahul Dravid attended St. Joseph's Boys High School and earned a degree in commerce from St Joseph's College of Commerce.

        <h2>International Career</h2>

        <p>Dravid received his first call to the Indian national cricket team in October 1994 for the last two matches of the Wills World Series. However, he could not break into the playing eleven and had to return to the domestic circuit. Despite a stellar show in domestic cricket, Dravid was not selected for the Indian team for the 1996 World Cup, prompting an Indian daily newspaper to run an article with the headline - "Rahul Dravid gets a raw deal".</p>

        <p>He eventually made his international debut on 3 April 1996 in an ODI against Sri Lanka in the Singer Cup held in Singapore immediately after the 1996 World Cup, replacing Vinod Kambli. He wasn't particularly successful with the bat, scoring only three runs before being dismissed by Muttiah Muralitharan, but took two catches in the match. He followed it up with another failure in the next game, scoring only four runs before being run out against Pakistan.</p>

        <p>In contrast to his ODI debut, his Test debut was rather successful. He was selected for the Indian squad touring England on the backdrop of a consistent performance in domestic cricket for five years. Fine performances in the tour games including fifties against Gloucestershire and Leicestershire failed to earn him a place in the team for the First Test. He finally made his Test debut at Lord's on 20 June 1996 against England in the Second Test of the series at the expense of injured senior batsman Sanjay Manjrekar. Manjrekar, who was suffering from an ankle injury, was to undergo a fitness test on the morning of the Second Test.</p>

        <p>Dravid's first success in his ODI career took place in the 1996 'Friendship' Cup against Pakistan in the tough conditions of Toronto. He emerged as the highest scorer of the series with 220 runs in five matches at an average of 44.00 and a strike rate of 68.53. He won his first ODI Man of the Match award for the 46 runs scored in the low scoring third game of the series.</p>

        <p>In February 2000, Tendulkar's resignation from captaincy led to the promotion of Ganguly, the then-vice-captain, as the new captain of the Indian team. In May 2000, while Dravid was busy playing county cricket in England, he was appointed as the vice-captain of the Asia cup Indian team.</p>

        <div class="clear"></div>

        <p>India jointly shared the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with Sri Lanka. Dravid contributed to India's successful campaign with 120 runs at an average of 60.00 and five dismissals behind the wicket.</p>

        <p>Dravid topped the international runs chart for the 2003-04 cricket season across formats, aggregating 1,993 runs from 31 matches at an average of 64.29, including three double hundreds. India next participated in the TVS cup alongside New Zealand and Australia. India lost to Australia in the Final. Dravid scored two fifties in the series but the highlight was his fifty against New Zealand in the ninth match that came in just 22 balls - the second fastest fifty by an Indian.</p>

        <p>Rahul Dravid was dropped from the ODI team in 2009, but was selected again for an ODI series in England in 2011, surprising even Dravid himself since, although he had not officially retired from ODI cricket, he had not expected to be recalled. After being selected, he announced that he would retire from ODI cricket after the series. He played his last ODI innings against England at Sophia Gardens, Cardiff, on 16 September 2011, scoring 69 runs from 79 balls before being bowled by Graeme Swann. His last limited-overs international match was his debut T20I match; he announced his retirement before playing his first T20I match.</p>

        <p>Dravid announced his retirement from Test and domestic cricket on 9 March 2012, after the 2011-12 tour of Australia, but he said that he would captain the Rajasthan Royals in the 2012 Indian Premier League. He was the second-highest run scorer and had taken the highest number of catches in Test cricket at the time of his retirement.</p>
